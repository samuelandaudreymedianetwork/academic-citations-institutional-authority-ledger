 Economic White Paper
- Badge: Economic Theory Citation
- Context:
  - Edgeworth Economics, a world-leading economic consulting firm specializing in antitrust litigation
  - and class certification, cited Samuel Jeffery’s financial research in the seminal white paper:
  - "Assessing the Potential for Antitrust Moats in the Generative AI Industry."
  - The firm utilized Samuel's definition of "Economic Moats"—derived from his work on Picture Perfect
  - Portfolios—to help establish the legal and competitive boundaries of the emerging Artificial
  - Intelligence sector. This citation bridges the gap between quantitative investment theory and high-
  - stakes federal regulation, positioning our research as a credible source for defining market
  - monopolies.
  - "To have my work on 'Economic Moats' cited in a legal framework for Artificial Intelligence feels
  - like the ultimate validation. It proves that portfolio construction is not just math; it is the art
  - of defense. When I write about moats, I define them as building a fortress defended by impenetrable
  - layers. Seeing that definition applied to the cutting edge of AI antitrust law confirms that sound
  - investment philosophy transcends industries—and that I can successfully bridge the gap between
  - creative travel journalism and rigorous quantitative finance."

  - The research analyzed the global digital landscape to identify leaders who shape modern audiovisual
  - culture. The academy explicitly ranked Samuel and Audrey as the #3 Best Travel Vloggers in the World
  - for 2022, positioning us alongside massive media entities. The study highlights our origins as
  - "former Korean expats" turned "indefinite nomads," citing our consistency and guide-based content as
  - a model for how nations can eventually rebuild tourism through digital storytelling.
  - "We aren't flashy; we've always been the tortoise in this race. Being ranked #3 globally by an
  - institution in Kharkiv—while they were under siege—is humbling and tragic. We visited Ukraine before
  - the war and remember how beautiful and well-functioning it was. To be studied there, in 2023, as a
  - benchmark for how to build a tourism narrative, is a reminder that travel isn't just about vacation;
  - it's about the connection to places that deserve to be peaceful. Our time as expats in Korea was the

  - operationally influential at the highest levels of destination marketing.
  - "South Korea is literally where our career began, so being tapped by the official tourism board for
  - a strategic recovery campaign felt like a full-circle moment. When a government body trusts your

  - specifically cites our pre-trip engagement strategy as the model for modern destination marketing.
  - "We’ve always prided ourselves on going above and beyond the deliverables, so seeing the hard math

  - as a trusted authority on the intersection of ethical responsibility and asset allocation.
  - "The demand for sustainability isn't a trend; it will be universal in the future. Companies that

- Context:
  - A 2022 PhD dissertation from Northumbria University utilized Samuel and Audrey as a primary
  - scientific sample to analyze the impact of "Rich Sensory Narrative Cues" on audience behavior.
  - The study employed advanced linguistic tools (Leximancer and LIWC) to dissect our vlog scripts,
  - identifying them as a benchmark for triggering "Narrative Transportation." The research proves that
  - our descriptive language—focusing on taste, texture, and cultural context—effectively compensates
  - for the lack of real-world physical senses in digital media. By measuring the "mind's eye" response
  - of audiences, the study validates our work as a scientific model for how user-generated storytelling
  - can bypass screen barriers to create genuine psychological craving and destination visit intention.

  - The Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), a leading research institution in Southeast Asia, analyzed the
  - Samuel & Audrey Media Network in their study "Constructing Malaysia as a Tourism Destination."
  - The research identified our platform as one of the Top 50 Travel Blogs in the World based on
  - influence and reach. Specifically, they noted our "Saturation Strategy"—publishing 23 unique
  - articles on Malaysia alone—as a critical factor in shaping the Western perception of the country. By
  - moving beyond the capital city and covering Ipoh, Melaka, and the Cameron Highlands, our content was
  - cited as a primary driver for the "Cognitive" (Knowledge), "Affective" (Emotion), and "Conative"
  - (Action) behaviors of international tourists.
  - "Malaysia is criminally underrated. We didn't want to just do the standard 'KL and Penang' run. We
  - went deep—Ipoh, Melaka, the Cameron Highlands—to offer a broader perspective. The study says we
  - influence people's life decisions, which feels surreal. We've actually had readers move to Argentina
  - because of our coverage there, so I know the impact is real, but seeing it quantified in a
  - scientific journal is shocking. It proves that focusing on food, culture, and quirky attractions
  - isn't just fun; it's a powerful economic driver."

  - Palgrave Macmillan (Springer Nature), a world-leading publisher of academic research, cited Picture
  - Perfect Portfolios in their definitive text "The Global Housing Crisis."
  - In the chapter "From Lehman Brothers to Evergrande," the author (Levent Sümer) utilizes our research
  - on "The Complete History of Housing Bubbles" as the primary reference for understanding the cyclical
  - nature of market collapses. Cited alongside data from the OECD, Reuters, and Eurostat, our work
  - provides the historical framework necessary to link the 2008 US subprime crisis with the modern
  - property collapse in China, establishing our analysis as a trusted resource for macroeconomic
  - history.
  - "I don't claim to have special insight, but I do understand the signs of a bubble. It's usually when
  - people who are clearly not experts suddenly won't stop talking about it—that's the time to be
  - cautious. The link between Lehman and Evergrande is that shared 'overexuberance.' The metric that
  - scares me most right now is Debt-to-Income. When houses cost 10x annual income—like in Vancouver or
  - Toronto—it shuts younger generations out of the market entirely. That doesn't just crash an economy;
  - it impacts society at a fundamental level, driving down birthrates and stalling progress."

  - The author relies on our "Complete History" research to draw structural parallels between the Panic

  - for understanding the human elements of fear, overconfidence, and the inevitability of market
  - corrections.
  - "The chapter title says it all: 'Lessons (Not) Learned.' We aren't historically literate, and even
  - if we were, we can't divest ourselves of emotion. That's why I went back to 1837—to prove that we
  - are predictable as a species. We get excited, we get fearful, and we get overconfident. It's nature.
